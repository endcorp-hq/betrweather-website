# Betrweather Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 01 September 2025
Last Updated: 01 September 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how [END CORP LTD] (“Betrweather,” “we,” “us,” “our”) collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you use the Betrweather mobile application, website(s), and related services (collectively, the “App”).

By using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

## Who We Are (Data Controller)

[END CORP LTD] is the data controller for personal data processed via the App.
Email: privacy@betrweather.xyz

## What We Collect

We collect information in three ways: (a) you provide it, (b) collected automatically, (c) from third parties.

### Information You Provide

Support communications and in-app feedback

Preferences: notification settings, units, saved locations/favorites

(Optional) Wallet/address identifiers or app handles, if you connect them

### Information Collected Automatically

Device & app data: device model, OS version, app version, language, time zone, mobile network, app interactions, performance and crash logs

Usage data: screens viewed, features used, referral sources, session timing

Location data:

Approximate location (IP-based) for regional forecasts and content

Precise location (GPS/BLE/Wi-Fi) only if you grant permission; used to show local weather/alerts and location-aware features. You can disable this in device settings

Cookies/SDKs: on our website and in-app SDKs for analytics, performance, crash reporting, and (if enabled) attribution

### Data From Third Parties

Weather, geospatial, and alert datasets from public/private providers

Platform stores (Apple/Google) for install/receipt validation

Analytics, attribution, and crash-reporting partners

We do not knowingly collect special category data (e.g., health, biometrics) through the App.

### Why We Use Your Data (Legal Bases)

Under UK/EU law, we process personal data based on:

Contract: to provide and maintain the App and features you request

Legitimate interests: to secure and improve the App, prevent fraud/abuse, understand usage (balanced against your rights)

Consent: for push notifications, precise location, certain analytics/marketing, or where required by law

Legal obligations: to comply with applicable laws and enforce our terms

### How We Use Your Data

Provide core functionality (forecasting, alerts, saved locations)

Personalize content (e.g., local conditions, units, recent places)

Send push notifications (e.g., weather alerts) if enabled

Monitor and improve performance, usability, and security

Debug and fix crashes; analyze trends and feature usage

Communicate with you about updates, changes, and support

Enforce terms, prevent misuse, and comply with legal requests

We do not use your precise location for advertising without your explicit consent.

### Sharing Your Data

We share information with:

Platform providers: Apple/Google for distribution, receipts, and compliance

Legal and safety: to comply with law, enforce terms, or protect rights, safety, and security


### International Transfers

Your data may be processed outside your country (including the UK/EU/US). When we transfer personal data internationally, we use lawful safeguards such as adequacy decisions, Standard Contractual Clauses, or equivalent mechanisms.

### Data Retention

We keep personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described here, and as required by law. Retention depends on your use and our obligations (e.g., security logs, accounting records). When no longer needed, we delete or anonymize data.

### Security

We use technical and organizational measures to protect data (encryption in transit, access controls, least-privilege, monitoring). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. You are responsible for protecting your device, account credentials, and (if used) wallets/keys.

### Your Rights (UK/EU/EEA)

Subject to exceptions, you may have the right to:

Access, correct, or delete your personal data

Restrict or object to processing

Data portability

Withdraw consent at any time (does not affect prior lawful processing)

Lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority (e.g., ICO in the UK)

To exercise rights, contact privacy@betrweather.xyz
. We may need to verify your identity.

### Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 16 (or the age of consent in your country). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided data, contact us to delete it.

### Cookies & SDKs

Website cookies: used for essential functionality, analytics, and (if enabled) limited marketing/attribution. You can manage preferences in your browser or our cookie banner (where available).

In-app SDKs: analytics, performance, crash reporting, and messaging. You can limit some collection via system settings (e.g., reset ad ID, limit tracking) or in-app settings where offered.

### Push Notifications & Location

Notifications: enabled only with your permission; you can disable in device settings or in-app.

Precise Location: requested only to enable location-aware features; you can deny or revoke at any time in device settings. Approximate location may still be inferred from IP for regional content.

### California Privacy (CCPA/CPRA)

If you are a California resident, you have the rights to know, correct, delete, and opt-out of sale/share of personal information, and to non-discrimination for exercising these rights.

Sale/Share: We do not sell personal information for money. Some analytics/attribution uses may be considered “sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising under CPRA. You can opt out via [Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information] and/or by adjusting device settings (Limit Ad Tracking/Ad Personalization).

Sensitive PI: We do not use Sensitive PI to infer characteristics or for purposes beyond those permitted by law.

Submit requests at privacy@endcorp.co
 or via [web form link]. We will verify requests as required.

### Third-Party Links & Services

The App may link to third-party services, content, or sites. Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies. We are not responsible for third-party practices.

### Automated Decision-Making / Profiling

Betrweather does not engage in automated decisions producing legal or similarly significant effects on you. We may use limited profiling (e.g., recent locations, app usage) to personalize UX and notifications, subject to your settings and consent where required.

### Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be posted here with a new “Effective Date,” and we may notify you in-app. Continued use of the App after changes take effect means you accept the updated Policy.
